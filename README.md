# Astro Static Playground

This repository is a small playground for exploring Astro with React, Vue, Tailwind CSS, and SCSS.
Nothing here is final - it's just a space to try things out and experiment.

A `/dist` folder is included so the built output can be viewed directly.

- Astro
- React 19
- Vue 3
- Tailwind CSS
- Sass (SCSS)

## Installation

```
pnpm install
